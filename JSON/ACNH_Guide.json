You do not have to pick up everything that you ordered.\n\n>  Order gold nuggets or royal crowns instead of bells. A full inventory of these items sells for 12M bells\n\n> Use the following command to order a full inventory of Nook Miles Tickets: `.order nook miles ticket`\n\n> You can order items and a villager at the same time. To add a villager to your order just add the villager code at the end of your order. Here is an example on how to do so by using the item and villager example used in the tutorials above. `.order 0000006200000E06 villager:cat23`\n\n>  After submitting your order, the bot will DM you instructions. When it's your turn, the bot will DM you a dodo code. Be ready, input the code in your game and fly to my island to retrieve your items/villager. Make sure your inventory is empty so that you can get your items.",
