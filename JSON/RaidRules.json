(<#882818625243844628>) We will post a message that will be published with raid details similarly to how it was done in Sword and Shield. \n\n:star2: Since there is no benefit to adding raid host switches to friends list, friend codes have been entirely made irrelevant and will go unshared. \n\n:star2: Every raid posted will have a link code! You will have to wait and watch in this channel for each individual raid post to begin. \n\n:star2: Every raid will be **Shiny**! Raids will rotate periodically but not daily as they are more difficult to setup than in SwSh."

For example, if we host a Dragonite den starting at 1 PM CST, you may join that specific raid up to 5 times. There is no specific time limit to how the raid will be hosted for since there are many factors that potentially contribute to it crashing. The bot will post images of each raid lobby before the raid begins to show us each user that joins. If you are continuously joining raids without following this rule, you will be banned from future raids. \n\n> **R2**. Do not intentionally leave or throw a raid lobby. If you are found to be purposefully griefing a lobby, you will be banned from future raids. \n\n> **R3**. Do not share raid link codes with users who are either not members of this server or have been banned from raids. This behavior will also result in a ban.\n\n> **R4**. Do not ask when raids will be running and for how long. They will be available when we have time to host"
